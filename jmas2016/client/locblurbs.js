  bamp: "  <p>A little plaza sits on the northwest corner of Oxford &amp; Addison.\n    A short metal fence bounds this plaza's south side, preventing the\n    careless from tumbling into a sunken parking lot. Go there.\n",
  brow: "  <p>Make your way to 2150 Allston Way, between Shattuck and Oxford Streets.\n    There find a fence made of metal \u201cslats\u201d with a design twisted into them.\n    The design might remind you of a pair of eyes or perhaps a sound wave.\n    When you\u2019re by the fence, listen to this:\n",
  clok: "  <p>On the west side of Shattuck Avenue a few paces south of Allston Way,\n    a clock measures time and announces it to all people within view.\n    \"Civic time\" is a curious thing: its worth is not in its accuracy or\n    precision, but in how useful it is to members of a society who\n    want to synchronize with each other.\n\n",
  colg: "  <p>At 2050 Center Street, east of Milvia, is Berkeley City College.\n    Enter the building and walk up some steps to the atrium,\n    where a thin, woven metal fence surrounds a hole below.\n    \n  <p>Pace around this fence as you listen to this track.\n",

  poem: "  <p>On the south side of Addison Street near a dangling potted\n    plant attached to a streetlight, there is a poem embedded in\n    the sidewalk, entitled THE WORLD.\n    Once you locate it, play the track below.\n",
  vine: "  <p>Go to Trumpetvine Court. It\u2019s a courtyard behind Jupiter Taproom;\n    there are entrance passageways on Allston Way and on Shattuck.\n    When you\u2019re there, listen:\n",
