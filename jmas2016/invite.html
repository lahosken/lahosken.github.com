<h1>On the <var>N</var>th Day of Kväsmäss, my Ascendant Tithed to Me&hellip;</h1>

<p>For this jaunt, point your smartphone's browser at
  <a href="https://lahosken.github.io/jmas2016/client/">https://lahosken.github.io/jmas2016/client/</a> and hie yourself to downtown
  Berkeley, within a block of Shattuck and Center.
  There, you will take an hour to
  explore vibrations, frequency, resonance, waves, and cycles.

<p>Things change; things move. We tend to think in terms of
  permanent changes, permanent moves: transformations, shifting.
  But we're surrounded by things that move <em>constantly</em>
  and yet return to their old position, cycling through states.
  Some of these we can perceive with our senses; others we can
  only reason about or guess at.
