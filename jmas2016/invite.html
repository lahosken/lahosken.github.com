<h1>On the 8th Day of Kväsmäss, my Ascendant Tithed to Me&hellip;</h1>

<p>In this jaunt, we seek the Guardians.
  Bring a penny with you, or a coin if you prefer,
  as well as a rigid stick object,
  or some abraxis if you have some.
  It is best performed in the hours of 9-5 on a non-Sunday day.

<p>We see the Guardians of Frequency and Resonance, Waves and Cycles
  flit through the air if we know where to look.
  Today we seek them in
  <b>Downtown Berkeley, near Shattuck Ave and Center St.</b>

<p>Please point a smartphone browser (preferably with GPS function), to
  <a href="https://lahosken.github.io/jmas2016/client/">https://lahosken.github.io/jmas2016/client/</a>,
  hook up your earphones, and then make your way to Berkeley.

Your phone will ask your permission to track your location. This permission lets it show your location on a map.

<p><b>Collaborators, Playtesters:</b> This is a rough draft. Some things
  are missing. Some bits of text just plain end abruptly because we haven't
  finished 'em yet.
