  <p>suppose you received a Jauntmas email that said&hellip;

<h1>On the 8th Day of Kväsmäss, my Ascendant Tithed to Me&hellip;</h1>

<p>In this jaunt, we seek the Guardians.
  Bring a penny with you, or a coin if you prefer,
  as well as a rigid stick object,
  or some abraxis if you have some.

<p>It is best performed in the hours of 7:30-5:30.
  If you do this on Sunday,
  you'll be locked out of one place but you can &ldquo;fake it.&rdquo;

<p>We see the Guardians of Frequency and Resonance, Waves and Cycles
  flit through the air if we know where to look.
  Today we seek them in
  <b>Downtown Berkeley, near Shattuck Ave and Center St.</b>

<p>Please point a smartphone browser (preferably with GPS function), to
  <a href="https://lahosken.github.io/jmas2016/client/">https://lahosken.github.io/jmas2016/client/</a>,
  hook up your earphones, and then make your way to Berkeley.

Your phone will ask your permission to track your location. This permission lets it show your location on a map.

<p><b>Collaborators, Playtesters:</b> This is a rough draft. Some things
  are missing. We know the audio has some pauses &amp; repeated bits;
  and start with phrases like "Jaunt, Audio, Oxford and Addison";
  this is an early edit; leftover bits are still in there.<br>
  <b>Feedback:</b> On slack, send feedback via direct message to
  <tt>bork</tt> and <tt>lahosken</tt>.<br>
  <b>Stuck?</b> If something goes wrong and/or you're stuck, call or text
  lahosken at <tt>1-415-868-4629</tt><br>
  <b>Phone browser stuck?</b> Try the less-fancy version of the map:
  <a href="https://lahosken.github.io/jmas2016/client/?fancy=no">https://lahosken.github.io/jmas2016/client/?fancy=no</a>&nbsp;; it might work better.
  <em>In your feedback, be sure to mention that your phone had problems with
  the fancy version of the map</em>.
