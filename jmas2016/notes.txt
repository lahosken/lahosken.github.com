The World, Alice Jones

My ears (shaped just like his)
echo too loudly, everything too
much, turtle, without my shell.
I am a gong that has been
unstruck. Still reverberating
from what is taken away, and
never was. A thousand sharp
leaves press against the window,
that tide, the clank of my spoon
against the blue china mug.

It doesn't take much
to make music.
