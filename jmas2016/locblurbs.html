  <p>On this corner of Shattuck Square and Addison Street,
    a slightly more peaceful space just a block away from
    the crowded bustling thoroughfares that surround you,
    take a moment. Stand on the sidewalk and
    pay attention to those cross your path as you listen to the audio below.

<section id="brow">
  <p>Make your way to 2150 Allston Way, between Shattuck and Oxford Streets.
    There, find a fence made of metal “slats” with a design twisted into them.
    The design might remind you of a pair of eyes or perhaps a sound wave.
    When you’re by the fence, listen to this:

<section id="clok">
  <p>On the west side of Shattuck Avenue a few paces south of Allston Way,
    a clock measures time and announces it to all people within view.

<section id="colg">
  <p>At 2050 Center Street, east of Milvia, is <b>Berkeley City College</b>.
    Enter the building and walk up some steps to the atrium,
    where a thin, woven metal fence surrounds a hole below.
    
  <p>Pace around this fence as you listen to this track.

<section id="fork">
  <p>There is an island at the intersection of Shattuck Ave and Center St, and in the middle of the island there is a giant, red tuning fork. 

  <p>Walk up to it, and press play.

<section id="pasg">
  <p>Look around you, feel in your pockets.
    Do you have a penny, or can you find a pebble?
    Once you have, make your way to the <b>Arts Passage</b>
    at 2055 Center Street, between Shattuck and Milvia.
    Make your way into the passage, and press play.

<section id="poem">
  <p>On the south side of Addison Street near a dangling potted
    plant attached to a streetlight, there is a poem embedded in
    the sidewalk, entitled <b>THE WORLD</b>. The photo might help
    you find the proper poetic plaque.
    Once you locate it, play the track below.

  <p>Go to Trumpetvine Court. It’s a courtyard behind Jupiter Taproom;
    there are entrance passageways on Allston Way and on Shattuck.
