  <p>A little plaza sits on the northwest corner of Oxford &amp; Addison.
    A short metal fence bounds this plaza's south side, preventing the
    careless from tumbling into a sunken parking lot.

  <p>Consider this fence. You might expect its pickets to interfere with its
    frequency, reduce it to rattles. But if you rap one of its horizontal
    spans with a knuckle, it vibrates truly. What craft it must require to
    join these pieces so well that they move as one?

  <p>At 2150 Allston Way (between Shattuck and Oxford), a metal fence
    protects a bike parking area. Its design suggests a sound wave (or
    perhaps a domino mask).

  <p>In the society, we heed the notion of <em>resonance</em>. An object
    can have a resonant frequency, one that makes it vibrate wholly.
    When joined in a suitable medium, one object can transmit vibrations
    to another. When two similar objects have the same resonant frequency,
    these transmissions can be especially notable.

  <p>Tap a few of the fence's slats; a slat's center is an especially
    good place to tap. Each slat's vibration is impressive,
    no matter whether its "twist" is short or long. One wonders how the
    frequency of such a slat would compare to a similarly-sized twist of
    metal <em>fusilli</em>.

  <p>On the west side of Shattuck Avenue a few paces south of Allston Way,
    a clock measures time and announces it to all people within view.
    "Civic time" is a curious thing: its worth is not in its accuracy or
    precision, but in how useful it is to members of a society who
    want to synchronize with each other.

  <p>Throughout history, we haven't just learned to measure time. We've
    learned to agree on "what time it is." Our ancestors announced changes
    of the watch with bells, with horns, with klaxons. We invented calendars,
    leap years, clocks, time zones, digital watches, and daylight savings
    time all so that friends can plan a get-together as easily as saying
    "Let's meet at noon on the 6th for lunch."
    
  <p>When you are done, look west to answer the question:
    What kind of station are you next to? _&nbsp;_&nbsp;_&nbsp;_

  <p>At 2050 Center Street, east of Milvia, is Berkeley City College.
    Enter the building and walk up some steps to the atrium.
    Consider the low barrier that preserves careless folks
    from tumbling into the basement.

  <p>Here we see an example of <em>weave</em>, a concept dear to the society.
    Notice how adjacent fence slats' "waves" have the same frequency but
    are out of phase. You might think this difference would prevent them
    from forming a structure, but its these differences that hold them
    together.

  <p>When you are done, look at a plaque by the library door to find
    the word that fills in the blank: "Her unshakable commitment

<section id="drum">
  <p>On the North side of this park is a little fenced in section
    with some labeled column-tops and some low cylinders that are
    maybe supposed to be drums? Which seems like something we could
    use? But the drum tops are these pieces of metal that I couldn't
    get good sounds out of? So I'm not even that certain that these
    are supposed to be drums? I dunno. If you have any brilliant ideas,
    don't be shy about 'em.

<section id="fork">
  <p>At the island in the center of the intersection of Shattuck and Center
    looms a giant tuning fork. Walk up to it. (Watch for traffic, of course.)

  <p>This tuning fork, titled Free Oscillation of the Earth, is a sort of
    tribute to the vibrational frequency of the earth.
    The earth's frequency is low, so low that we
    don't feel its movement as a vibration. We can measure it, we can
    reason about it; but when you stand on the earth's surface, there's
    feel of rumbling (unless, perhaps, a BART train passes under).
    Yet the earth connects us all; if we could feel its vibrations, it
    would be a rare shared experience.

  <p>Follow the directions TO SAMPLE THE EARTH SONG. THE EARTH SONG may be
    imperceptable. If that disappoints you (or even if it doesn't),
    you might try knocking on a few other bits of the fork you can reach.
  
  <p>When you are done, look at a plaque to find the last source of
    random vibrations (before the "etc") and enter it.

  <p>Arts Passage, Center Street, west of Shattuck Ave.

  <p>Hey playtesters/collaborators/folks, this here is another spot
    I'm not sure what (if anything) to do with.

  <p>Waves on ceiling. But they aren't sound waves. They're sound-baffling
    waves. Uhm, I got nuthin'. It's kind of a neat spot, though. Maybe
    someone has a better idea of what to do with it?

  <p>There's a wavy bench? That's a sort of waveform. Maybe we could

<section id="poem">
  <p>On the south side of Addison Street
    west of Shattuck Avenue, there is a recessed gray
    door under a black and orange sign marking "PRIVATE PROPERTY".
    Before that door, on the ground sits a poem titled "The World".

  <p>We think of resonant frequencies as sounds; a poet might evoke
    a similar phenomenon with words. This poem talks about music and
    silence passing thoughts and feelings from one person to another.
    And of course if we pause to understand the poem, it passes
    thoughts and feelings from the poet to us.

  <p>Read this poem aloud. Some of its words resound; others crackle and snap.
    Reflect on the poet's choices.

  <p>When you are done, look at the poem to find what it <em>doesn't<em>
    take to make music. Enter that word.

  <p>When I was here, there was music playing on speakers? But I don't
